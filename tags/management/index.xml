      <description>I was reorganizing some files today, and found some (handwritten! :) notes from years past&amp;hellip; worth posting them, although they&amp;rsquo;re not very structured.

 set directions make decisions solve problems  (not my definition, by the way&amp;hellip; David expanding on what this means)
On centralized &amp;ldquo;platform&amp;rdquo; teams Platform as a Service is very similar in the way most old style IT programmes were: you built a central reusable service because it&amp;rsquo;s cheaper to operate common services centrally than reinvent the wheel every time.</description>

      <description>I like a lot to wander around a grocery store, browsing the shelves and thinking at the tasty dishes I could turn all those ingredients into. One thing I don&amp;rsquo;t like is queuing up at the cashier, which usually is a long endeavour as people (at least here in HK) expect the cashier to both scan their items and bag them, collect the payment, etc etc&amp;hellip;
So I was very pleased to find out about a feature in the mobile app of a known supermarket chain in Hong Kong.</description>

      <description>In the past few months, as HSBC ramps up its digital investment and seek to reorganize the way it delivers digital products, I have been asked this question many times.
In some cases, people mean &amp;ldquo;Can you explain to me how your technology platform look like&amp;rdquo;. In other cases, the person asking was interested in how we built and organized the team, how we structure ourselves to be agile and lean, a &amp;ldquo;small startup inside a big corporation&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Last week, Scott Guthrie was in London and gave a ‘private’ presentation about Azure to some teams in the company I work for…
I could not be there in person, but I’m told the below video has pretty much the same content… so I watched it.
couldn&amp;#39;t be in London yesterday, so watching @Azure demo by @scottgu today ..my own #AzureSaturday ;) https://t.co/XJBOgqrcKT #cloud #Azure

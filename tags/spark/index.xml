      <description>In early October, a delegation from PayMe team went to Amsterdam to attend the Spark+AI Summit.
 It was a productive week of sharing experiences, meeting practitioners, as well as learn what&amp;rsquo;s coming next in the Spark ecosystem&amp;hellip;
We also had a chance to share our experience using data and Databricks to enable a Data Driven Roadmap for our #paymehk products (PayMe and PayMe for Business)&amp;hellip;
&amp;hellip;some say it&amp;rsquo;s worth 18 minutes of your time&amp;hellip; see it for yourself :)</description>

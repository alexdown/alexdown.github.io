      <description>Octopus card is, by all standards, a success story. Introduced in 1997 by a consortium of railway and bus companies, for transit ticketing purposes, it subsequently expanded to other payment usages (restaurants, parking, convenience stores) following Hong Kong Monetary Authority granting Octopus&amp;rsquo; operating company a deposit-taking license.
Pretty much everywhere you go in Hong Kong, you can pay with Octopus. It&amp;rsquo;s as close as one can get to a cashless society utopia.</description>

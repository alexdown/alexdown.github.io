      <description>In the past few months, as HSBC ramps up its digital investment and seek to reorganize the way it delivers digital products, I have been asked this question many times.
In some cases, people mean &amp;ldquo;Can you explain to me how your technology platform look like&amp;rdquo;. In other cases, the person asking was interested in how we built and organized the team, how we structure ourselves to be agile and lean, a &amp;ldquo;small startup inside a big corporation&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share about a book I am reading now&amp;hellip; which I found memorable mainly for the type of teamwork and leadership it&amp;rsquo;s describing.
 GBS_insertEmbeddedViewer(&#39;ISBN:0743214471&#39;,300,480);   What about it?
It&amp;rsquo;s describing work practices from the Gemini and Apollo mission control teams. Now: those were the people who worked - together with the astronauts - on all aspects of the space missions. They were involved in definition of objectives, feasibility, planning, to the design of every single aspect of the flights.</description>

      <description>Context There were times (and till to date) when we build grand enterprise architectures with capabilities and alternatives for each: from business to technical to infrastructure viewpoints, followed by year long development cycles. While the adoption of agile (any flavor of agile) has changed the way we think about development and start delivering incremental value, the architecture itself has either been ignored (“agile don’t need upfront architecture!”), or continues to follow a waterfall development.</description>

      <description>I like a lot to wander around a grocery store, browsing the shelves and thinking at the tasty dishes I could turn all those ingredients into. One thing I don&amp;rsquo;t like is queuing up at the cashier, which usually is a long endeavour as people (at least here in HK) expect the cashier to both scan their items and bag them, collect the payment, etc etc&amp;hellip;
So I was very pleased to find out about a feature in the mobile app of a known supermarket chain in Hong Kong.</description>

      <description>I was reorganizing some files today, and found some (handwritten! :) notes from years past&amp;hellip; worth posting them, although they&amp;rsquo;re not very structured.
On the Role of the Architect If I look at how I spend most of my time&amp;hellip; Technology Architects/ Technology Strategist do three things:
 set directions make decisions solve problems  (not my definition, by the way&amp;hellip; David expanding on what this means)
On centralized &amp;ldquo;platform&amp;rdquo; teams Platform as a Service is very similar in the way most old style IT programmes were: you built a central reusable service because it&amp;rsquo;s cheaper to operate common services centrally than reinvent the wheel every time.</description>

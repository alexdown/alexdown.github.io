      <description>I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share about a book I just finished reading&amp;hellip; which I found memorable mainly because it provides a simple framework to understand what - at first look - seems to all of us working in big companies just corporate politics against common sense.
The book is &amp;ldquo;The Innovator&amp;rsquo;s Dilemma&amp;rdquo;, by Clayton Christensen.

      <description>I like a lot to wander around a grocery store, browsing the shelves and thinking at the tasty dishes I could turn all those ingredients into. One thing I don&amp;rsquo;t like is queuing up at the cashier, which usually is a long endeavour as people (at least here in HK) expect the cashier to both scan their items and bag them, collect the payment, etc etc&amp;hellip;
So I was very pleased to find out about a feature in the mobile app of a known supermarket chain in Hong Kong.</description>

      <description>I was reorganizing some files today, and found some (handwritten! :) notes from years past&amp;hellip; worth posting them, although they&amp;rsquo;re not very structured.
On the Role of the Architect If I look at how I spend most of my time&amp;hellip; Technology Architects/ Technology Strategist do three things:

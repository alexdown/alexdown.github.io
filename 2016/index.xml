      <description>Almost a year ago I started working with WeChat… I prepared a small intro, but did not share it widely back then.
This evening I presented it - updated- to the Hong Kong codeaholics meetup.
Enjoy!
 When we talk about &amp;ldquo;WeChat&amp;rdquo; (or &amp;ldquo;WeiXin&amp;rdquo;, 微信), most think of one of many smartphone apps used to chat. And this is true - as the app&amp;rsquo;s main window contains a list of your friends&amp;rsquo; contacts (slide 3).</description>

      <description>I had a chance to participate to the first ever beta launch event for a new bank app, last week in Hong Kong. Pretty much like for the other challenger banks out there, there were drinks, pizza, the founders and team there to answer questions and help explore the app, and lots of interesting people willing to talk and share their idea of how a bank should look like.
I don&amp;rsquo;t want to write another dull &amp;ldquo;unboxing&amp;rdquo; post explaining every single step/screen I went through, so here are the screenshots.</description>

      <title>A Better Octopus Card</title>

      <description>Octopus card is, by all standards, a success story. Introduced in 1997 by a consortium of railway and bus companies, for transit ticketing purposes, it subsequently expanded to other payment usages (restaurants, parking, convenience stores) following Hong Kong Monetary Authority granting Octopus&amp;rsquo; operating company a deposit-taking license.
Pretty much everywhere you go in Hong Kong, you can pay with Octopus. It&amp;rsquo;s as close as one can get to a cashless society utopia.</description>

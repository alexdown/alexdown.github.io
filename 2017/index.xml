      <description>Last week, Scott Guthrie was in London and gave a ‘private’ presentation about Azure to some teams in the company I work for…
I could not be there in person, but I’m told the below video has pretty much the same content… so I watched it.
couldn&amp;#39;t be in London yesterday, so watching @Azure demo by @scottgu today ..my own #AzureSaturday ;) https://t.co/XJBOgqrcKT #cloud #Azure

      <description>I happened to be in Guangzhou last week, and attending an interesting round table discussion during a banking technology event.
One of the guests was from WeBank, sharing his experience working in a technology company that happens to hold a banking license in China.
He shared the fact that they started as a technology company even before they had the license, developing a banking platform that is now used by 8 local banks in China in a BaaS (Banking as a Service) model.</description>

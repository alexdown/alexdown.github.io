      <description>Few days ago, Cathay Pacific released its new mobile app.
I downloaded the android version, and gave it a try. TL;DR? It&amp;rsquo;s better than it used to be, looks more modern, but there are a number of bugs still open, and questionable design chooices have been made. Here are a few comments.
 Two different loading spinners: why?

      <description>One year after my first (and - so far - only) blog post about Coin, the company seems to be in trouble: backers are (rightfully) concerned about the product launch postponed for six months, and commentators ask what are the future plans for the product after its target market - the US - adopt EMV chip cards.
 It seems most of the backers are concerned about the future in regards to the rollout of chip cards in the US, but the FAQ on coin website don&amp;rsquo;t do much to address the concern, insisting it will work during US&amp;rsquo; EMV transition period and if it has a magnetic stripe.</description>
